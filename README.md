🏦 Loan Risk Prediction using Machine Learning
An end-to-end ML project to classify loan applicants as Low Risk or High Risk based on factors like income, loan amount, credit history, and employment. Includes data preprocessing, model building, performance comparison, and a Streamlit app for live predictions.

🚀 Highlights
Cleaned & preprocessed real-world loan dataset.

Feature engineering: missing value handling, encoding, scaling.

Class imbalance solved with SMOTE.

Trained XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression.

Deployed Streamlit web app with saved ML pipeline.
